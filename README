After spending hours trying to fullfill all the prerequisites for XML modules,
to build this UPS module, I relized there's a deffinate need for a simple XML
solution without a load of prerequisites.  I designed this module to be 100%
self sufficient.  No additional modules are needed.

Using this module requires an UPS account.  You can get an account at 
www.ups.com/

See INSTALL.interchange to install the Interchange user tag.
